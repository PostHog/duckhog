# Test: Invalid connection string (missing user) should fail
statement error
ATTACH 'hog:memory' AS remote;

Missing username

# Note: Invalid endpoints and unreachable servers create catalogs in
# "disconnected mode" - ATTACH succeeds but queries will fail.
# This is tested in the integration tests with a running server.
